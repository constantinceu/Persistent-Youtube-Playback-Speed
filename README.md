# Persistent-Youtube-Playback-Speed
Firefox Extension that supplies a Persistent Youtube Playback Speed that never changes on its own.

### Firefox Installation

Install the Release File

Editing default speed:
  - After installation, use Options page (right-click the extension → Manage Extension → Options) to change the stored speed (applies immediately).

Notes:
  - The Options page writes the value to browser.storage.local and this value is used every time a YouTube video runs.
